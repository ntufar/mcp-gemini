# mcp-gemini Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality
Code must be clean, readable, and maintainable. It should adhere to established coding standards and best practices. All code must be peer-reviewed before merging.

### II. Testing Standards
Every feature must have comprehensive unit and integration tests. Test-Driven Development (TDD) is strongly encouraged. A minimum of 80% code coverage is required for all new contributions.

### III. User Experience Consistency
The user interface and experience must be consistent across the entire application. All new features and components must adhere to the established design system and style guides to ensure a seamless and intuitive user journey.

### IV. Performance Requirements
The application must meet defined performance benchmarks for key user interactions, including response times and resource utilization. All new code must be profiled and optimized to prevent performance regressions.

## Governance

All development must adhere to the principles outlined in this constitution. Proposed changes to this constitution require a formal amendment process, including review and ratification by the project stewards.
