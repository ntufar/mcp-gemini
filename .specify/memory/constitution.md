# MCP Server Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Security First
All code must be written with security as the top priority. This includes robust input validation, sandboxing of file system operations, and measures to prevent any form of unauthorized access or malicious command execution.

### II. Clear API Contracts
The server's API must be clearly defined and documented using the OpenAPI specification. All API changes must be versioned according to semantic versioning to ensure backward compatibility and a clear evolution path.

### III. Modular and Extensible
The server must be built with a modular architecture. New commands and functionalities should be implementable as self-contained plugins or modules, minimizing the need for core system refactoring.

### IV. Comprehensive Observability
The server must provide structured, actionable logs for all operations. Key metrics on API usage, performance, and errors shall be exposed to allow for effective monitoring, debugging, and alerting.

### V. Rigorous Testing
Every feature must be accompanied by a full suite of tests, including unit, integration, and end-to-end tests. Security-specific tests, including penetration and vulnerability scanning, are mandatory before any release.

## Governance

All development must adhere to the principles outlined in this constitution. Proposed changes to this constitution require a formal amendment process, including review and ratification by the project stewards.
