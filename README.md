# MCP Server

**MCP Server** is a lightweight, secure server that empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) to browse and interact with local file systems. It provides a simple API for listing directories and reading files, enabling LLMs to access local data and perform tasks that require file system access.

## Features

- **Secure by Design**: MCP Server is built with security as a top priority. It uses a sandboxed environment to prevent any unauthorized access to files or directories outside of a specified root directory.
- **Simple API**: A straightforward API with two main endpoints for listing directories and reading files.
- **Observability**: Detailed logging of all requests and responses for easy monitoring and debugging.
- **Extensible**: The modular architecture allows for easy extension with new commands and functionalities.
