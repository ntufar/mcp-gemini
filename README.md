# MCP Server

**MCP Server** is a lightweight, secure server that empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) to browse and interact with local file systems. It provides a simple API for listing directories and reading files, enabling LLMs to access local data and perform tasks that require file system access.

## Features

- **Secure by Design**: MCP Server is built with security as a top priority. It uses a sandboxed environment to prevent any unauthorized access to files or directories outside of a specified root directory.
- **Simple API**: A straightforward API with two main endpoints for listing directories and reading files.
- **Observability**: Detailed logging of all requests and responses for easy monitoring and debugging.
- **Extensible**: The modular architecture allows for easy extension with new commands and functionalities.

## API

### List Directory

The `fs.listDirectory` method allows an LLM to list the contents of a specified directory.

- **Method**: `fs.listDirectory`
- **Request**:
  ```json
  {
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "fs.listDirectory",
    "params": {
      "path": "/path/to/directory"
    },
    "id": 1
  }
  ```
- **Response**:
  ```json
  {
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "result": {
      "files": [
        {
          "name": "file.txt",
          "path": "/path/to/file.txt",
          "size": 1024,
          "modified_date": "2025-09-20T10:00:00Z"
        }
      ],
      "directories": [
        {
          "name": "subdir",
          "path": "/path/to/subdir"
        }
      ]
    },
    "id": 1
  }
  ```

### Read File

The `fs.readFile` method allows an LLM to read the contents of a specified file.

- **Method**: `fs.readFile`
- **Request**:
  ```json
  {
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "fs.readFile",
    "params": {
      "path": "/path/to/file.txt"
    },
    "id": 2
  }
  ```
- **Response**: The content of the file will be returned as a string in the `result` field.
  ```json
  {
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "result": "This is the content of the file.",
    "id": 2
  }
  ```
