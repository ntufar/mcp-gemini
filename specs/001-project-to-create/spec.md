# Feature Specification: MCP Server for Local File Browsing

**Feature Branch**: `001-project-to-create`  
**Created**: 2025-09-20  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "project to create MCP Server to help LLM to browse local directories and files"

---

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an LLM, I want to be able to browse local directories and files on a user's machine so that I can access and process local data to answer user queries more effectively.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the MCP Server is running, **When** I send a request to list the contents of a directory, **Then** I receive a list of files and subdirectories.
2. **Given** the MCP Server is running, **When** I send a request to read the contents of a file, **Then** I receive the content of that file.
3. **Given** the MCP Server is running, **When** I send a request to a directory that does not exist, **Then** I receive an error message indicating that the directory was not found.
4. **Given** the MCP Server is running, **When** I send a request to read a file that does not exist, **Then** I receive an error message indicating that the file was not found.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a request is made to a restricted directory?
- How does the system handle very large files?
- How does the system handle binary files?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST provide an API endpoint to list the contents of a specified directory.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST provide an API endpoint to read the contents of a specified file.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST handle requests for non-existent files and directories gracefully by returning an appropriate error message.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST NOT allow access to files or directories outside of a specified root directory (sandboxing).
- **FR-005**: The system MUST log all requests and responses for observability.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST be able to handle files up to 10MB in size.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST handle binary files and deliver them as is.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **File**: Represents a file on the local file system. Attributes: name, path, size, modification date.
- **Directory**: Represents a directory on the local file system. Attributes: name, path.
